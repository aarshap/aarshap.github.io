        <p>When the staff of The Outline was laid off and the site was shut down last April, it was a loss for a cleaner, less aggressively monetized Internet. Their site featured an objectively better reading experience compared to sites suffocated with programmatic display ads and affiliate links. Instead of selling every possible pixel, The Outline’s team created bespoke, individually designed ads designed to compliment the reading experience &ndash; not wreck it. So when the site was sold to Bryan Goldberg, a human gargoyle and a bad boss in an industry rife with bad bosses, those of us who anticipated the worst were eventually proved right. He chose to invest elsewhere and once again, we were stuck reading websites designed like tabloid ads.</p>

<p>Fast forward five months &ndash; though it feels way, way longer. If you spend time on the same corner of the Internet I do (the corner with good blogs), you’ve been anticipating the launch of Defector &ndash; a worker-run media company owned by the former staff of Deadspin following their walkout in protest of Barry Petchevsky’s firing last October.</p>

<p>Tom Ley summarized the incident in Defector’s inaugural post, which you can read here. Really, go read it. I’ll wait. And support independent media by giving them $99 while you’re there.</p>

<p>To summarize his summary, Tom writes that the Defector team wants to “create a website that you will actually want to read.” The mission is a response to their boss’s meddling in their writing &ndash; a demand that they stick to sports despite Deadspin’s undeniable traffic driven by politics, bears, recipes, and goofball humor.</p>

<p>That bad boss (I said we were rife with them) was Jim Spanfeller, who looks like a decades-old file photo of someone in prison for mutual fund fraud. I mean, look at this guy.</p>

<p>Despite owning a brain wrecked with dull ideas and venture capital, Spanfeller may have inadvertently uncovered a better path forward for an industry similarly wrecked by dull ideas and venture capital. Discourse Blog, another worker-owned venture founded by writers of fellow Spanfeller casualty Splinter, also launched this year. They also deserve your money.</p>

<p>Defector launched with their own website built by digital design agency Alley Interactive. Discourse Blog is built on Substack &ndash; the subscription-based newsletter service your friends have all started using this year. While Defector and Discourse Blog launched differently, they both pursued an honest subscription model over one inundated with gaudy ads. Like The Outline before them, I can comfortably turn my ad blocker off without risking damage to my flammable body, my flammable computer, or my flammable neighbors residing in a flammable building. Maybe there’s a place for good blogs after all.</p>

<p>So, what’s nice about Defector’s site?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Readers aren’t beaten over the head with calls to subscribe. When there are calls to subscribe, it’s stated honestly. No mystery links masquerading as articles leading to dead end pages. Like Drew Magary said in this thread, “[We] have a subscription model that costs you some money but frees both you and us from OCEANS of bullshit.”
  <li>It loads fast, probably because there aren’t dozens of third-party ad scripts.
  <li>Defector trusts you’re smart enough to recognize their real writers with real personalities. Avatars and bylines on the homepage are prominent and the site isn’t forced to rely on virtually anonymous headline bait.
  <li>Their UX copy isn’t written like a subway ad, laden with unnecessary wordplay. When they ask you to subscribe to a newsletter or download a podcast, it’s stated plainly.
  <li>There’s a sponsor, but it’s clearly labeled. Defector isn’t trying to trick you into clicking on a sponsored Warby Parker article by disguising it in a grid of non-sponsored writing.
</ul>

<p>The site’s not perfect. Defector uses the frustratingly common pattern of detecting “departing user intent” by revealing a last-ditch popup when mousing out of the browser window. But it’s still an improvement over the fully ad-supported sites I’ve become accustomed to navigating. And with Defector so soon after the aforementioned Deadspin walkout, hiccups can be expected.</p>

<p>The cheeky “a website you will actually want to read” mission reflects something I struggled with during my time working in media. If you’re a member of a product team at a media company focused on profitability, you’ll be asked to make your website, apps, and social media presence objectively worse for your readers. For the most part, you won’t be given the opportunity to experiment and fail like The Outline did. You’ll design incomprehensible features defined by sales terms, plaster intrusive ads on your most trafficked pages, and integrate slow, third-party ad products hawking celebrity gossip and diet fads. You’re a user experience designer tasked with designing an unusable experience for your users, riddled with dark patterns meant to maximize ad impressions and viewability.</p>

<p>It’s easy to get discouraged in an environment like this. But if the Spanfeller casualties could leave and give us something better, why can’t you?</p>

<p>There’s no shortage of writing on media’s transformation over the last decade. We’ve pivoted to video, catered to Facebook’s algorithm, and a/b tested our headlines to the point of illegibility. Local newspapers are replacing local reporting with aggregated AP stories. “Media is hard,” I’ve tweeted, following one of the rounds of layoffs that have all melded together. While journalists are eating the brunt of shit from their companies’ failures, it’s the product teams working on behalf of their company’s respective Spanfeller, executing lazy ideas lazily.</p>

<p>Rethinking how we monetize a struggling industry is harder than slapping another paid rectangle on a page, even with diminishing returns on each lower-brow ad product. When the options are months of risky design iteration or accepting an up-front offer from a loan shark like Outbrain or Taboola, the profitability vultures in charge will usually pursue the latter.</p>

<p>Can larger, ad-supported newsrooms succeed with a model like Defector’s? Paywalls aren’t new. I’d been working on introducing accounts to VICE for years with expectations that they’d eventually be monetized. But there’s something refreshingly DIY about Defector’s approach. They don’t treat their readers like a commodity. They talk to their readers like people &ndash; people who can make informed, honest choices with money that’s increasingly harder to come by.</p>

<div class="media-wrap-outer">
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I try to duck paywalls just like everyone else. I hit the wall on WaPo and other places and am STILL surprised I hit it.

<p>In the wake of The Outline’s demoralizing closure, worker-owned companies like Defector and Discourse Blog are giving us relief from bosses who care more about revenue than writing. But because our lives are lived online, those writers and editors need product teams to show the same courage the Defector team did. It won’t be easy. You’ll make less money with less certainty. But you’ll help build a better, more readable Internet that doesn’t make you want to saw your entire head off.</p>

<p>The staff of Deadspin walked out in response to Petchevsky’s firing, but Petchevsky was fired for protesting bad ideas from bad bosses. If you’re a designer, engineer, or on a product team, I know you’re fielding similarly bad ideas. How are you pushing back?</p>
